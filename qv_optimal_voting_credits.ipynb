    "# This notebook describes the development of a set of functions seeking to numerically determine the optimal number of quadratic voting credits '*C*' given how many distinct items '*N*' are being voted on.\n",
    "- **In sum, given a quadratic ballot with N issues, how many voting credits should be given?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.  This was done to address one of the strongest criticisms of Quadratic Voting (QV), wasted voting power (vote credits that cannot be used without changing the voting intention of the voter).  This is particularly true of small N ballots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Note: Another way of doing QV is through continuous, or \"infinitely divisible\" votes.  Thus, a voter can use any N real numbers that when squared and added together equal C.  While this solves the wasted credit issue, there are still game theory implications to different levels of C.  This is a future path of investigation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.  As mentioned in the note above, there are optimal strategies from both a game theory and computational front.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.  Limitations:  This notebook is limited to discrete, positive integer votes.  It does not take into account negative votes for a ballot item like many QV frameworks do.  Having negative votes will likely alter the method of selecting strategies and is another path of investigation.  Also, perfectly rational voters are asumed - thus, while the model only uses rational strategies in its mechanics, in reality the voters will have the full set of possibilities to choose from, including ones where they have a better strategy than what their voting is, or making suboptimal tradeoffs.  This should be irrelevant, as strategy sets should be judged on rational voting."

    "## Key Terms and Concepts Explored Below\n",
    "1. QUADRATIC VOTING (QV): Voting method where voters are given a number of voting credits 'C' and allowed to distribute them across a series of N-items.  The credits convert to tallied votes at a rate of $\\sqrt(C)$ per voting item.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DECISION SPACE: The collection of N-items being quadratically voted on, where N is a positive integer.  Basically a ballot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. VOTING ITEM: One of N-items (voting choices) that a voter can spend voting power on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. VOTER: An individual who choses a voting strategy by assinging voting power, quadratically, across voting items within an N-sized decision space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. VOTE: How much voting power is ultiamtely assigned to a Voting Item given the voter's strategy. $V = \\sqrt(C)$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. VOTE CREDIT: 'C' units of voting power which convert into votes quadratically.  The goal of this notebook is to find optimal values of C given N.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. STRATEGY: The set of numbers which represent how a voter voted using their voting power.  For example, when N = 4 & C = 50, one voting strategy that wastes no credits would be: [7,1,0,0].  Strategies go from highest vote count on the left to lowest on the right as each strategy represents all equivalent voting strategies (i.e. [4,2,1,0,0] == [2,4,0,0,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. MAX VOTE: 'Vmax' = The maximum possible vote on a single voting item for a given C.  Always lower than total votes from a given strategy, unless C is a perfect square and all voting power is used on a single voting item; in that case they are equal. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. NULL STRATEGY: A voting strategy where all votes are equivalent, ie. [2,2,2], [4,4,4,4,4,4], etc..  These are all equivalnet to [0,..,0], aka not voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. STRATEGY SET: The collection of strategies available for a given set of parameters (N and m or C).  Range from \"Complete\" (all non-null strategies, with Equivalent Strategies consolidated to one) to \"Reduced Form\".\n",
    "\n",
    "10. REDUCED FROM (OF STRATEGY SET): The set of strategies that use the minimal number of votes to express a group of voters relative preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. EQUIVALENT STRATEGY: Equivalent strategies are all permutations of the same numbers within the voting space.  As such they combined into one for the analysis.  For example strategy [2,2,1] == [2,1,2] == [1,2,2]."

    "## Assumptions\n",
    "1. All null strategies are equivalent.\n",
    "2. All equivalent strategies are equivalent.\n",
    "3. N = 1 decouples into N = 2\n",
    "4. For N = 2, there is only one strategy, [1,0].  Therefore C(2) = 1.\n",
    "5. Voters are rational.  They will only waste voting credits if it fits their preferred strategy, and strategies suffer a penalty for wasting votes (waste factor).\n",
    "6. Voters will always seek to maximize their largest vote element rather than waste votes.  \n",
    "7. Voters most concerned about the fairness of their vote, not the absolute."
