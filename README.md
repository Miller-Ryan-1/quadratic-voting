## To be updated...

This repo consists of a Jupyter notebook and a .py file of the functions developed in the notebook.  The notebook is initial work towards developing and demonstrating the optimal vote credit amount for a quadratic vote of N-issues.  

The notebook (and calling the function 'strategies_for_n' in the .py file) will generate all strategies for N up to the vote credit count C.  It also gives a number of metrics for each of these strategy sets.

Currently trying to figure out how these metrics determine the best number of C given N.

Future explorations include:
    1. Negative Voting
    2. Continuous Voting
